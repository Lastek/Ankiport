Attach your pdf document or whatever you want to be used for studying and then put in the first prompt

First Prompt:
	Can you turn this document into anki notecards i can use for studying?

	Can you turn this document into Anki notecards I can use for studying? Just output plain text where you have a 'Card #:' and then a Q/A style for each card.
