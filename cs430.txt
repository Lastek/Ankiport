Card 1:
Q: What is a relation schema in a database?
A: A relation schema is the logical structure of a relation, defined by a set of attributes (A1, A2, ..., An). For example, instructor = (ID, name, dept_name, salary) describes the structure of an instructor relation.
Card 2:
Q: What is the difference between a database schema and a database instance?
A: Database schema is the logical structure of the database, while a database instance is a snapshot of the actual data in the database at a specific moment in time.
Card 3:
Q: What is a superkey in a relational database?
A: A superkey is a set of attributes that can uniquely identify a tuple in a relation. For example, in an instructor relation, {ID} and {ID, name} are both superkeys.
Card 4:
Q: What distinguishes a candidate key from a superkey?
A: A candidate key is a minimal superkey - the smallest set of attributes that can uniquely identify a tuple. For example, {ID} is a candidate key for the instructor relation.
Card 5:
Q: What is the domain of an attribute in a database?
A: The domain is the set of allowed values for an attribute. Attribute values are typically required to be atomic (indivisible), and the special value 'null' is a member of every domain.
Card 6:
Q: What is a foreign key constraint in a database?
A: A foreign key constraint requires that a value in one relation must appear in another relation. It establishes a link between two relations, with one relation referencing another.
Card 7:
Q: What is a fundamental characteristic of relations in a relational database?
A: Relations are unordered, meaning the order of tuples is irrelevant and tuples may be stored in an arbitrary order.
Card 8:
Q: What is a tuple in a relational database?
A: A tuple is an individual row in a relation, representing a single record or entry in the database table.
Card 9:
Q: What is the significance of the 'null' value in database attributes?
A: The 'null' value indicates that the value is "unknown" and is a member of every domain. However, it can cause complications in defining various database operations.
Card 10:
Q: How is a primary key selected in a relational database?
A: A primary key is selected from the candidate keys. It is typically the most appropriate and meaningful candidate key that can uniquely identify each tuple in the relation.
