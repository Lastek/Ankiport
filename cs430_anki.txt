Q: What is a relation schema in a database?	A: A relation schema is the logical structure of a relation, defined by a set of attributes (A1, A2, ..., An). For example, instructor = (ID, name, dept_name, salary) describes the structure of an instructor relation.<br>	database database_attributes database_relations schema
Q: What is the difference between a database schema and a database instance?	A: Database schema is the logical structure of the database, while a database instance is a snapshot of the actual data in the database at a specific moment in time.<br>	database schema
Q: What is a superkey in a relational database?	A: A superkey is a set of attributes that can uniquely identify a tuple in a relation. For example, in an instructor relation, {ID} and {ID, name} are both superkeys.<br>	database database_attributes database_keys database_relations
Q: What distinguishes a candidate key from a superkey?	A: A candidate key is a minimal superkey - the smallest set of attributes that can uniquely identify a tuple. For example, {ID} is a candidate key for the instructor relation.<br>	database_attributes database_keys database_relations
Q: What is the domain of an attribute in a database?	A: The domain is the set of allowed values for an attribute. Attribute values are typically required to be atomic (indivisible), and the special value 'null' is a member of every domain.<br>	database database_attributes
Q: What is a foreign key constraint in a database?	A: A foreign key constraint requires that a value in one relation must appear in another relation. It establishes a link between two relations, with one relation referencing another.<br>	database database_keys database_relations
Q: What is a fundamental characteristic of relations in a relational database?	A: Relations are unordered, meaning the order of tuples is irrelevant and tuples may be stored in an arbitrary order.<br>	database database_relations
Q: What is a tuple in a relational database?	A: A tuple is an individual row in a relation, representing a single record or entry in the database table.<br>	database database_relations
Q: What is the significance of the 'null' value in database attributes?	A: The 'null' value indicates that the value is "unknown" and is a member of every domain. However, it can cause complications in defining various database operations.<br>	database database_attributes
